The file named 'Stokes wave solution under linealy sheared currents.wl' is designed for the ones who would like to derive the fifth-order Stokes wave solutions under linearly sheared currents. One can use it to derive the solutions starting from the first order problem. The functions 'B1[i_]' and 'B2[i_]' provide the ith-order combined surface boundary condition and dynamic condition, respectively, when all the potentional functions and surface elevation functions that are lower than ith-order are provided. The function 'solveeachorderequation[u_,jo_]' is used to derive the solution of ith-order potential function stemming from the forced terms in combined surface boundary condition, after that one can use 'B2[i_]' to derive the ith-order solution of surface elevation.
The file named 'An example for fifth-order Stokes wave solution under linearly sheared currents.nb' provides an example, which shows the process of using the Stokes wave solutions to calculate the surface elevation and velocity distribution, if necessary parameters such as wave height, wave period, water depth, surface current and vorticity are provided.
